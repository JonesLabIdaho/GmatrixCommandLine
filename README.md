# GmatrixCommandLine
The command-line version of the G-matrix simulator.

This program has the same functionality as the other G-matrix simulators,
but without the graphical interface.

The source code should compile with any modern C++ compiler.

The repository also includes a manual and some useful scripts.
See the manual for more details.
